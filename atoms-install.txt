\f0\fs24 \cf0 Ato-ms : Installation instructions.\
\
This is an experimental prototype distribution, this text file is intended to help you through the installation steps of this software. This procedure is quite easy but will require a reboot of your computer during the process.\
\
1) Install a MySQL Server, the latest OSX 10.6 version is available in this folder, or you can download one for your OS at : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/"}}{\fldrslt http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/}}\
\
2) Add the MySQL.prefPane to your preferences panel (it will allow you to quickly check that the SQL server is running at startup), you can also use the startup item package.\
\
3) Reboot your computer\
\
4) Check that the SQL server is running in your preferences\
\
5) Launch the Ato-ms.pkg installation package and follow instructions.\
Warning : The 'script execution' step is responsible for importing and structuring the knowledge database. Because of the current size of feature knowledge (~1.5 Gb), this step may take a long time before completion (~ 5-10 minutes).\
\
6) Start the Ato-me.app in your Applications folder.\
\
If you encounter any problem or the application doesn't seem to work, two files are available to narrow down the problem :\
/tmp/atomsInstallReport.txt\
/tmp/atomsInstallOut.txt\
\
You can send any question or problems (along with the two install text files) at :\
